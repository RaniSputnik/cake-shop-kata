## Requirements

- The shop can gift-wrap cakes in fancy boxes. Fancy boxes have a lead time of 3 days. Boxes can arrive while the friends are working on the cake,
- The shop can decorate cakes with nuts. Unfortunately, Sandro is allergic to nuts, so Marco does this job. Decorating a cake with nuts takes 1 extra day, and has to happen after any frosting has finished.
- The shop closes for Christmas from the 23rd of December and is open again on the 2nd of January. Cakes that would be complete in that period will be unable to start production until re-opening. Fancy boxes will continue to arrive throughout the festive period.
